# TemperatureApp
Android App which connects my Node RESTful API server hosted by EC2 and gets inhouse temperature from database and outside weather by fetching a openweathermap API

Small personal project to see my indoors temperature and outdoors weather in a quick glimpse from my android app.

Example of earlier version of my NodeJs REST API https://github.com/eemilk/TemperatureApp/blob/master/node/index.js

My Raspberry Pi thermosendor data to database script: https://github.com/eemilk/DB-sendvalues-python/blob/master/dbconnection.py
